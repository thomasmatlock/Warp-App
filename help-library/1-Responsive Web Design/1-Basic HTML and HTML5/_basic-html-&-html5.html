<!--Link to External Pages with Anchor Elements-->
You can use a (anchor) elements to link to content outside of your web page.
a elements need a destination web address called an href attribute. They also need anchor text. Here's an example:
<a href="https://freecodecamp.org">this links to freecodcamp.org</a>
Then your browser will display the text "this links to freecodecamp.org" as a link you can click. And that link will
take you to the web address https://www.freecodecamp.org.


<!--Link to Internal Sections of a Page with Anchor Elements-->
a (anchor) elements can also be used to create internal links to jump to different sections within a webpage.
To create an internal link, you assign a link's href attribute to a hash symbol # plus the value of the id attribute for
the element that you want to internally link to, usually further down the page. You then need to add the same id
attribute to the element you are linking to. An id is an attribute that uniquely describes an element.
Below is an example of an internal anchor link and its target element:
<a href="#contacts-header">Contacts</a>
...
<h2 id="contacts-header">Contacts</h2>
When users click the Contacts link, they'll be taken to the section of the webpage with the Contacts header element.

Change your external link to an internal link by changing the href attribute to "#footer" and the text from "cat photos"
to "Jump to Bottom".
Remove the target="_blank" attribute from the anchor tag since this causes the linked document to open in a new window
tab.
Then add an id attribute with a value of "footer" to the <footer> element at the bottom of the page.


    <!--Nest an Anchor Element within a Paragraph-->
    You can nest links within other text elements.
    <p>
        Here's a <a target="_blank" href="http://freecodecamp.org"> link to freecodecamp.org</a> for you to follow.
    </p>

    Let's break down the example: Normal text is wrapped in the p element:
    <p> Here's a ... for you to follow. </p> Next is the anchor element <a> (which requires a closing tag </a>):
    <a> ... </a> target is an anchor tag attribute that specifies where to open the link and the value "_blank"
    specifies to
    open the link in a new tab href is an anchor tag attribute that contains the URL address of the link:
    <a href="http://freecodecamp.org"> ... </a> The text, "link to freecodecamp.org", within the a element called anchor
    text, will display a link to click:
    <a href=" ... ">link to freecodecamp.org</a> The final output of the example will look like this:

    Here's a link to freecodecamp.org for you to follow.

    Now nest the existing a element within a new p element (just after the existing main element). The new paragraph
    should
    have text that says "View more cat photos", where "cat photos" is a link, and the rest of the text is plain text.


    <!--Make Dead Links Using the Hash Symbol-->
    Sometimes you want to add a elements to your website before you know where they will link.

    This is also handy when you're changing the behavior of a link using JavaScript, which we'll learn about later.

    The current value of the href attribute is a link that points to "http://freecatphotoapp.com". Replace the href
    attribute value with a #, also known as a hash symbol, to create a dead link.

    For example: href="#"

    <!--Turn an Image into a Link-->
    You can make elements into links by nesting them within an a element.

    Nest your image within an a element. Here's an example:

    <a href="#"><img src="https://bit.ly/fcc-running-cats" alt="Three kittens running towards the camera."></a>

    Remember to use # as your a element's href property in order to turn it into a dead link.

    Place the existing image element within an a (anchor) element.

    Once you've done this, hover over your image with your cursor. Your cursor's normal pointer should become the link
    clicking pointer. The photo is now a link.


    <!--Create a Bulleted Unordered List-->
    HTML has a special element for creating unordered lists, or bullet point style lists.

    Unordered lists start with an opening <ul> element, followed by any number of <li> elements. Finally, unordered
            lists close with a </ul>

    For example:

    <ul>
        <li>milk</li>
        <li>cheese</li>
    </ul>
    would create a bullet point style list of "milk" and "cheese".


    <!--Create an Ordered List-->
    HTML has another special element for creating ordered lists, or numbered lists.

    Ordered lists start with an opening <ol> element, followed by any number of <li> elements. Finally, ordered lists
            are closed with the </ol> tag.

    For example:

    <ol>
        <li>Garfield</li>
        <li>Sylvester</li>
    </ol>
    would create a numbered list of "Garfield" and "Sylvester".


    <!--Create a Text Field-->
    Now let's create a web form.

    input elements are a convenient way to get input from your user.

    You can create a text input like this:

    <input type="text">

    Note that input elements are self-closing.


    <!--Add Placeholder Text to a Text Field-->
    Placeholder text is what is displayed in your input element before your user has inputted anything.

    You can create placeholder text like so:

    <input type="text" placeholder="this is placeholder text">

    Note: Remember that input elements are self-closing.


    <!--Create a Form Element-->
    You can build web forms that actually submit data to a server using nothing more than pure HTML. You can do this by
    specifying an action on your form element.

    For example:

    <form action="/url-where-you-want-to-submit-form-data"></form>


    <!--Add a Submit Button to a Form-->
    Let's add a submit button to your form. Clicking this button will send the data from your form to the URL you
    specified with your form's action attribute.

    Here's an example submit button:

    <button type="submit">this button submits the form</button>


    <!--Use HTML5 to Require a Field-->
    You can require specific form fields so that your user will not be able to submit your form until he or she has
    filled them out.

    For example, if you wanted to make a text input field required, you can just add the attribute required within your
    input element, like this: <input type="text" required>


    <!--Create a Set of Radio Buttons-->
    You can use radio buttons for questions where you want the user to only give you one answer out of multiple options.

    Radio buttons are a type of input.

    Each of your radio buttons can be nested within its own label element. By wrapping an input element inside of a
    label element it will automatically associate the radio button input with the label element surrounding it.

    All related radio buttons should have the same name attribute to create a radio button group. By creating a radio
    group, selecting any single radio button will automatically deselect the other buttons within the same group
    ensuring only one answer is provided by the user.

    Here's an example of a radio button:

    <label>
        <input type="radio" name="indoor-outdoor">Indoor
    </label>
    
    IMPORTANT
    It is considered best practice to set a for attribute on the label element, with a value that matches the value of
    the id attribute of the input element. This allows assistive technologies to create a linked relationship between
    the label and the child input element. For example:

    <label for="indoor">
        <input id="indoor" type="radio" name="indoor-outdoor">Indoor
    </label>


    <!--Create a Set of Checkboxes-->
    Forms commonly use checkboxes for questions that may have more than one answer.

    Checkboxes are a type of input.

    Each of your checkboxes can be nested within its own label element. By wrapping an input element inside of a label
    element it will automatically associate the checkbox input with the label element surrounding it.

    All related checkbox inputs should have the same name attribute.

    It is considered best practice to explicitly define the relationship between a checkbox input and its corresponding
    label by setting the for attribute on the label element to match the id attribute of the associated input element.

    Here's an example of a checkbox:

    <label for="loving"><input id="loving" type="checkbox" name="personality"> Loving</label>


    <!--Use the value attribute with Radio Buttons and Checkboxes-->
    When a form gets submitted, the data is sent to the server and includes entries for the options selected. Inputs of
    type radio and checkbox report their values from the value attribute.

    For example:

    <label for="indoor">
        <input id="indoor" value="indoor" type="radio" name="indoor-outdoor">Indoor
    </label>
    <label for="outdoor">
        <input id="outdoor" value="outdoor" type="radio" name="indoor-outdoor">Outdoor
    </label>
    Here, you have two radio inputs. When the user submits the form with the indoor option selected, the form data will
    include the line: indoor-outdoor=indoor. This is from the name and value attributes of the "indoor" input.

    If you omit the value attribute, the submitted form data uses the default value, which is on.
    In this scenario, if the user clicked the "indoor" option and submitted the form, the resulting form data would be
    indoor-outdoor=on, which is not useful.
    So the value attribute needs to be set to something to identify the option.


    <!--Check Radio Buttons and Checkboxes by Default-->
    You can set a checkbox or radio button to be checked by default using the checked attribute.

    To do this, just add the word "checked" to the inside of an input element. For example:

    <input type="radio" name="test-name" checked>


    <!--Nest Many Elements within a Single div Element-->
    The div element, also known as a division element, is a general purpose container for other elements.

    The div element is probably the most commonly used HTML element of all.

    Just like any other non-self-closing element, you can open a div element with <div> and close it on another line
        with </div>.


    <!--Declare the Doctype of an HTML Document-->
    The challenges so far have covered specific HTML elements and their uses. However, there are a few elements that
    give overall structure to your page, and should be included in every HTML document.

    At the top of your document, you need to tell the browser which version of HTML your page is using. HTML is an
    evolving language, and is updated regularly. Most major browsers support the latest specification, which is HTML5.
    However, older web pages may use previous versions of the language.

    You tell the browser this information by adding the
    <!DOCTYPE ...> tag on the first line, where the ... part is the version of HTML. For HTML5, you use
    <!DOCTYPE html>.

    The ! and uppercase DOCTYPE is important, especially for older browsers. The html is not case sensitive.

    Next, the rest of your HTML code needs to be wrapped in html tags. The opening <html> goes directly below the
        <!DOCTYPE html> line, and the closing

    </html> goes at the end of the page.

    Here's an example of the page structure:

    <!DOCTYPE html>
    <html>
        <!-- Your HTML code goes here -->

    </html>


    <!--Define the Head and Body of an HTML Document-->
    You can add another level of organization in your HTML document within the html tags with the head and body
    elements. Any markup with information about your page would go into the head tag. Then any markup with the content
    of the page (what displays for a user) would go into the body tag.

    Metadata elements, such as link, meta, title, and style, typically go inside the head element.

    Here's an example of a page's layout:

    <!DOCTYPE html>
    <html>

        <head>
            <!-- metadata elements -->
        </head>

        <body>
            <!-- page contents -->
        </body>

    </html>
