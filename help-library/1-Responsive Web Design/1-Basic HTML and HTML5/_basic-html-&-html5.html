<!--Link to External Pages with Anchor Elements-->
You can use a (anchor) elements to link to content outside of your web page.
a elements need a destination web address called an href attribute. They also need anchor text. Here's an example:
<a href="https://freecodecamp.org">this links to freecodcamp.org</a>
Then your browser will display the text "this links to freecodecamp.org" as a link you can click. And that link will
take you to the web address https://www.freecodecamp.org.


<!--Link to Internal Sections of a Page with Anchor Elements-->
a (anchor) elements can also be used to create internal links to jump to different sections within a webpage.
To create an internal link, you assign a link's href attribute to a hash symbol # plus the value of the id attribute for
the element that you want to internally link to, usually further down the page. You then need to add the same id
attribute to the element you are linking to. An id is an attribute that uniquely describes an element.
Below is an example of an internal anchor link and its target element:
<a href="#contacts-header">Contacts</a>
...
<h2 id="contacts-header">Contacts</h2>
When users click the Contacts link, they'll be taken to the section of the webpage with the Contacts header element.

Change your external link to an internal link by changing the href attribute to "#footer" and the text from "cat photos"
to "Jump to Bottom".
Remove the target="_blank" attribute from the anchor tag since this causes the linked document to open in a new window
tab.
Then add an id attribute with a value of "footer" to the <footer> element at the bottom of the page.


    <!--Nest an Anchor Element within a Paragraph-->
    You can nest links within other text elements.
    <p>
        Here's a <a target="_blank" href="http://freecodecamp.org"> link to freecodecamp.org</a> for you to follow.
    </p>

    Let's break down the example: Normal text is wrapped in the p element:
    <p> Here's a ... for you to follow. </p> Next is the anchor element <a> (which requires a closing tag </a>):
    <a> ... </a> target is an anchor tag attribute that specifies where to open the link and the value "_blank"
    specifies to
    open the link in a new tab href is an anchor tag attribute that contains the URL address of the link:
    <a href="http://freecodecamp.org"> ... </a> The text, "link to freecodecamp.org", within the a element called anchor
    text, will display a link to click:
    <a href=" ... ">link to freecodecamp.org</a> The final output of the example will look like this:

    Here's a link to freecodecamp.org for you to follow.

    Now nest the existing a element within a new p element (just after the existing main element). The new paragraph
    should
    have text that says "View more cat photos", where "cat photos" is a link, and the rest of the text is plain text.


    <!--Make Dead Links Using the Hash Symbol-->
    Sometimes you want to add a elements to your website before you know where they will link.

    This is also handy when you're changing the behavior of a link using JavaScript, which we'll learn about later.

    The current value of the href attribute is a link that points to "http://freecatphotoapp.com". Replace the href
    attribute value with a #, also known as a hash symbol, to create a dead link.

    For example: href="#"

    <!--Turn an Image into a Link-->
    You can make elements into links by nesting them within an a element.

    Nest your image within an a element. Here's an example:

    <a href="#"><img src="https://bit.ly/fcc-running-cats" alt="Three kittens running towards the camera."></a>

    Remember to use # as your a element's href property in order to turn it into a dead link.

    Place the existing image element within an a (anchor) element.

    Once you've done this, hover over your image with your cursor. Your cursor's normal pointer should become the link
    clicking pointer. The photo is now a link.


    <!--Create a Bulleted Unordered List-->
    HTML has a special element for creating unordered lists, or bullet point style lists.

    Unordered lists start with an opening <ul> element, followed by any number of <li> elements. Finally, unordered
            lists close with a </ul>

    For example:

    <ul>
        <li>milk</li>
        <li>cheese</li>
    </ul>
    would create a bullet point style list of "milk" and "cheese".


    <!--Create an Ordered List-->
    HTML has another special element for creating ordered lists, or numbered lists.

    Ordered lists start with an opening <ol> element, followed by any number of <li> elements. Finally, ordered lists
            are closed with the </ol> tag.

    For example:

    <ol>
        <li>Garfield</li>
        <li>Sylvester</li>
    </ol>
    would create a numbered list of "Garfield" and "Sylvester".


    <!--Create a Text Field-->
    Now let's create a web form.

    input elements are a convenient way to get input from your user.

    You can create a text input like this:

    <input type="text">

    Note that input elements are self-closing.


    <!--Add Placeholder Text to a Text Field-->
    Placeholder text is what is displayed in your input element before your user has inputted anything.

    You can create placeholder text like so:

    <input type="text" placeholder="this is placeholder text">

    Note: Remember that input elements are self-closing.


    <!--Create a Form Element-->


    <!--Add a Submit Button to a Form-->


    <!--Use HTML5 to Require a Field-->


    <!--Create a Set of Radio Buttons-->


    <!--Create a Set of Checkboxes-->


    <!--Use the value attribute with Radio Buttons and Checkboxes-->


    <!--Check Radio Buttons and Checkboxes by Default-->


    <!--Nest Many Elements within a Single div Element-->


    <!--Declare the Doctype of an HTML Document-->


    <!--Define the Head and Body of an HTML Document-->
