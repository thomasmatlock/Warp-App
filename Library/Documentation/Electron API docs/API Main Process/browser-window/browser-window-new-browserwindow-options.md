It creates a new BrowserWindow with native properties as set by the options.

- width, Integer (optional) - Window's width in pixels. Default is 800.
- height, Integer (optional) - Window's height in pixels. Default is 600.
- x, Integer (optional) - (required if y is used) Window's left offset from screen. Default is to center the window.
- y, Integer (optional) - (required if x is used) Window's top offset from screen. Default is to center the window.
- useContentSize, Boolean (optional) - The width and height would be used as web page's size, which means the actual window's size will include window frame's size and be slightly larger. Default is false.
- center, Boolean (optional) - Show window in the center of the screen.
- minWidth, Integer (optional) - Window's minimum width. Default is 0.
- minHeight, Integer (optional) - Window's minimum height. Default is 0.
- maxWidth, Integer (optional) - Window's maximum width. Default is no limit.
- maxHeight, Integer (optional) - Window's maximum height. Default is no limit.
- resizable, Boolean (optional) - Whether window is resizable. Default is true.
- movable, Boolean (optional) - Whether window is movable. This is not implemented on Linux. Default is true.
- minimizable, Boolean (optional) - Whether window is minimizable. This is not implemented on Linux. Default is true.
- maximizable, Boolean (optional) - Whether window is maximizable. This is not implemented on Linux. Default is true.
- closable, Boolean (optional) - Whether window is closable. This is not implemented on Linux. Default is true.
- focusable, Boolean (optional) - Whether the window can be focused. Default is true. On Windows setting focusable: false also implies setting skipTaskbar: true. On Linux setting focusable: false makes the window stop interacting with wm, so the window will always stay on top in all workspaces.
- alwaysOnTop, Boolean (optional) - Whether the window should always stay on top of other windows. Default is false.
- fullscreen, Boolean (optional) - Whether the window should show in fullscreen. When explicitly set to false the fullscreen button will be hidden or disabled on macOS. Default is false.

- show, Boolean (optional) - Whether window should be shown when created. Default is true.
- paintWhenInitiallyHidden, Boolean (optional) - Whether the renderer should be active when show is false and it has just been created.  In order for document.visibilityState to work correctly on first load with show: false you should set this to false.  Setting this to false will cause the ready-to-show event to not fire.  Default is true.
- frame, Boolean (optional) - Specify false to create a Frameless Window. Default is true.
- parent BrowserWindow (optional) - Specify parent window. Default is null.
- modal, Boolean (optional) - Whether this is a modal window. This only works when the window is a child window. Default is false.

- transparent, Boolean (optional) - Makes the window transparent. Default is false. On Windows, does not work unless the window is frameless.
- type, String (optional) - The type of window, default is normal window. See more about this below.
- titleBarStyle, String (optional) - The style of window title bar. Default is default. Possible values are:
  - default - Results in the standard gray opaque Mac title bar.
  - hidden - Results in a hidden title bar and a full size content window, yet the title bar still has the standard window controls (""traffic lights"") in the top left.
  - hiddenInset - Results in a hidden title bar with an alternative look where the traffic light buttons are slightly more inset from the window edge.
  - customButtonsOnHover, Boolean (optional) - Draw custom close, and minimize buttons on macOS frameless windows. These buttons will not display unless hovered over in the top left of the window. These custom buttons prevent issues with mouse events that occur with the standard window toolbar buttons. Note: This option is currently experimental. "
- trafficLightPosition Point (optional) - Set a custom position for the traffic light buttons. Can only be used with titleBarStyle set to hidden
- fullscreenWindowTitle, Boolean (optional) - Shows the title in the title bar in full screen mode on macOS for all titleBarStyle options. Default is false.

Can be appearance-based, light, dark, titlebar, selection, menu, popover, sidebar, medium-light, ultra-dark, header, sheet, window, hud, fullscreen-ui, tooltip, content, under-window, or under-page.  Please note that using frame: false in combination with a vibrancy value requires that you use a non-default titleBarStyle as well. Also note that appearance-based, light, dark, medium-light, and ultra-dark have been deprecated and will be removed in an upcoming version of macOS.
- zoomToPageWidth, Boolean (optional) - Controls the behavior on macOS when option-clicking the green stoplight button on the toolbar or by clicking the Window > Zoom menu item. If true, the window will grow to the preferred width of the web page when zoomed, false will cause it to zoom to the width of the screen. This will also affect the behavior when calling maximize() directly. Default is false.
- tabbingIdentifier, String (optional) - Tab group name, allows opening the window as a native tab on macOS 10.12+. Windows with the same tabbing identifier will be grouped together. This also adds a native new tab button to your window's tab bar and allows your app and window to receive the new-window-for-tab event.

# webPreferences

- webPreferences Object (optional) - Settings of web page's features.
  - devTools, Boolean (optional) - Whether to enable DevTools. If it is set to false, can not use BrowserWindow.webContents.openDevTools() to open DevTools. Default is true.
  - nodeIntegration, Boolean (optional) - Whether node integration is enabled. Default is false.
  - nodeIntegrationInWorker, Boolean (optional) - Whether node integration is enabled in web workers. Default is false. More about this can be found in Multithreading.
  - nodeIntegrationInSubFrames, Boolean (optional) - Experimental option for enabling Node.js support in sub-frames such as iframes and child windows. All your preloads will load for every iframe, you can use process.isMainFrame to determine if you are in the main frame or not.
  - preload, String (optional) - Specifies a script that will be loaded before other scripts run in the page. This script will always have access to node APIs no matter whether node integration is turned on or off. The value should be the absolute file path to the script. When node integration is turned off, the preload script can reintroduce Node global symbols back to the global scope. See example here.
  - sandbox, Boolean (optional) - If set, this will sandbox the renderer associated with the window, making it compatible with the Chromium OS-level sandbox and disabling the Node.js engine. This is not the same as the nodeIntegration option and the APIs available to the preload script are more limited. Read more about the option here.
  - enableRemoteModule, Boolean (optional) - Whether to enable the remote module. Default is true. session Session (optional) - Sets the session used by the page. Instead of passing the Session object directly, you can also choose to use the partition option instead, which accepts a partition, String. When both session and partition are provided, session will be preferred. Default is the default session.
  - partition, String (optional) - Sets the session used by the page according to the session's partition, String. If partition starts with persist:, the page will use a persistent session available to all pages in the app with the same partition. If there is no persist: prefix, the page will use an in-memory session. By assigning the same partition, multiple pages can share the same session. Default is the default session. affinity, String (optional) - When specified, web pages with the same affinity will run in the same renderer process. Note that due to reusing the renderer process, certain webPreferences options will also be shared between the web pages even when you specified different values for them, including but not limited to preload, sandbox and nodeIntegration. So it is suggested to use exact same webPreferences for web pages with the same affinity.
  - Deprecated zoomFactor Number (optional) - The default zoom factor of the page, 3.0 represents 300%. Default is 1.0.
  - javascript, Boolean (optional) - Enables JavaScript support. Default is true.
  - webSecurity, Boolean (optional) - When false, it will disable the same-origin policy (usually using testing websites by people), and set allowRunningInsecureContent to true if this options has not been set by user. Default is true.
  - allowRunningInsecureContent, Boolean (optional) - Allow an https page to run JavaScript, CSS or plugins from http URLs. Default is false.

    - minimumFontSize, Integer (optional) - Defaults to 0. defaultEncoding, String (optional) - Defaults to ISO-8859-1. backgroundThrottling, Boolean (optional) - Whether to throttle animations and timers when the page becomes background. This also affects the Page Visibility API. Defaults to true. offscreen, Boolean (optional) - Whether to enable offscreen rendering for the browser window. Defaults to false. See the offscreen rendering tutorial for more details.
    - contextIsolation, Boolean (optional) - Whether to run Electron APIs and the specified preload script in a separate JavaScript context. Defaults to false. The context that the preload script runs in will still have full access to the document and window globals but it will use its own set of JavaScript builtins (Array, Object, JSON, etc.) and will be isolated from any changes made to the global environment by the loaded page. The Electron API will only be available in the preload script and not the loaded page. This option should be used when loading potentially untrusted remote content to ensure the loaded content cannot tamper with the preload script and any Electron APIs being used. This option uses the same technique used by Chrome Content Scripts. You can access this context in the dev tools by selecting the 'Electron Isolated Context' entry in the combo box at the top of the Console tab.
    - nativeWindowOpen, Boolean (optional) - Whether to use native window.open(). Defaults to false. Child windows will always have node integration disabled unless nodeIntegrationInSubFrames is true. Note: This option is currently experimental.
    - webviewTag, Boolean (optional) - Whether to enable the <webview> tag. Defaults to false. Note: The preload script configured for the <webview> will have node integration enabled when it is executed so you should ensure remote/untrusted content is not able to create a <webview> tag with a possibly malicious preload script. You can use the will-attach-webview event on webContents to strip away the preload script and to validate or alter the <webview>'s initial settings.
    - additionalArguments, String[](optional) - A list of, Strings that will be appended to process.argv in the renderer process of this app.  Useful for passing small bits of data down to renderer process preload scripts.
    - safeDialogs, Boolean (optional) - Whether to enable browser style consecutive dialog protection. Default is false.

    - navigateOnDragDrop, Boolean (optional) - Whether dragging and dropping a file or link onto the page causes a navigation. Default is false.
    - autoplayPolicy, String (optional) - Autoplay policy to apply to content in the window, can be no-user-gesture-required, user-gesture-required, document-user-activation-required. Defaults to no-user-gesture-required.
    - disableHtmlFullscreenWindowResize, Boolean (optional) - Whether to prevent the window from resizing when entering HTML Fullscreen. Default is false. accessibleTitle, String (optional) - An alternative title, String provided only to accessibility tools such as screen readers. This, String is not directly visible to users. spellcheck, Boolean (optional) - Whether to enable the builtin spellchecker. Default is true.
    - enableWebSQL, Boolean (optional) - Whether to enable the WebSQL api. Default is true.
    - v8CacheOptions, String (optional) - Enforces the v8 code caching policy used by blink. Accepted values are
      - none - Disables code caching
      - code - Heuristic based code caching
      - bypassHeatCheck - Bypass code caching heuristics but with lazy compilation
      - bypassHeatCheckAndEagerCompile - Same as above except compilation is eager. Default policy is code.
